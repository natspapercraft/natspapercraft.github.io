## Welcome to Nat's Paper Craft!

My name is Natalie.  My love of crafting started with scrapbooking and has grown to include all sorts of paper items, ranging from greeting cards to Advent calendars.  I use simple stamp, scrap, and embellishing techniques to make unique hand-made items.

Apart from the unique creations, I have made multiple items following particular themes for weddings and corporate stationery.

A collection of my cards, albums, and other paper creations are available for sale.  The items are reasonably priced and  I think offer better quality and value than you typically find with preprinted cards in other stores. Sales help to recover my costs and make more items! If you see a design you like but would like it modified, please let me know.
